# A Custom Version of `forEach` for Sake of Learning

Why a custom function that works like `forEach`?

So we can better conceptualize how `forEach` works

## Instructions

Follow the process we learned in <https://github.com/SummerOfCode2020/week-04-forking-from-the-org>

### First

- Fork
- Clone your personal copy to your local
- cd into the project
- Run `npm install`
- Note there were no dependencies for this project
- Run `npm start` to see the output

### Next Use the Debugger

- In VS Code, add a breakpoint to line 66 in [custom-for-each.js](custom-for-each.js)
- In VS Code, Open [package.json](package.json)
- Click the "Debug" icon that is above the `scripts` property
- Select to debug the `start` script when prompted
- Note the variables and the iteration logic we can see in the debugger
- Click the play button for Continue. F8 is the shortcut key as another option
- Note the changing variables
- Repeat clicking Continue to see each iteration and it's variables

## Then Change the Breakpoint

- Remove previously set breakpoints
- Add a breakpoint to line 102
- Run the debugger again
- Note the variables
- Click the play button for Continue
- Note the changing variables
- Repeat clicking Continue to see each iteration and it's variables

## Finally

We will plan to cover this in class to see how we can use this to understand what `forEach` does.
